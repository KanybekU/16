#  Date structure
## Short description
**This project is focused on date manipulation. It begins by prompting the user to input dates in the format MM/DD/YYYY, with each component separated by a forward slash "/". Following this input, the program determines which of the entered dates occurred earlier.

Utilizing a formula, the program calculates the day of the week for both dates. Subsequently, it calculates and displays the difference in days between the two dates.

I've reviewed the screenshots you provided to understand the workflow. Best of luck with your coding! If you need further assistance, feel free to ask.**
